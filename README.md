Source code for an RPG game.
To run the game, type "java -jar asmura.jar" in terminal. Must be `Java` 13, NOT 14.
The application opens with a black background (menu screen). To enter "main game", press enter (white background), and press q to toggle between main game and escaped screen (gray background).
The player is represented by an orange square in all 3 screens, movable with WASD.
(FOR DEVS) To fix merge conflicts with `asmura.jar`, in Eclipse one can select the option to Export as a runnable JAR file.
