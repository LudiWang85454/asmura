Navgiari City is the capital of the Kingdom of Navgiari and its largest settlement.
It is home to the court of General Yilohu and the hub of the army.
Layout:
  The city is divided into four main quarters that radiate out from the central FOUNTAIN OF THE FOUNDING, a monument to the original founding of Navgiari.
  The northeast district contains all the major government installations including the army barracks where the player must report to; Yilohu's palace, ENMEMNI PALACE; and the royal vaults, where the Talisman of Justice is kept.
  The northwest is the commercial district, containing:
    A shop selling Potion Alephs and Elixir Alephs.
    A hotel where the player can recover hp and mp to full for 16g.
    A magic shop selling Stun Aleph for 20g.
    Other shops that have conviniently have NPCs blocking the clerk  // gAmEdEsIgN
    It also contains the gate to the Nakai Woods
  The southwest is the residential district. Most of the dorrs are locked because that's how normal people work.
  Scattered throughout are open houses which have:
    1:
      MS. MENREEN who says, "I swear I fixed that lock. Oh well, maybe it's not so bad to meet new people."
      SERENA who says, "I found this on the floor, but dad says sharing is caring," and gives you 3g.
    2:
      MR. OWITS who says, "The city's where I've lived my whole life, but sometimes I just want to get away. I wish I was as young as you so I could see the world."
    3:
      MRS. CEZAERI: "Oh how brave of you to join the army."
  The southeast is going to be something, I guess. Anyway so it has the gate to QUENT ROAD.
